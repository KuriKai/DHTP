## Introduction

The DHTP (DOOM High-resolution Texture Project) is a community driven project that had is birth as the D2RP (Doom 2 Retexture project). That project initially had a good start, but was unfortunately misguided during the course of its development, and couldn't realistically be rescued without a lot of attention. Thus, JDTP (jdoom texture pack) came into being (Thanks to Chilvence). To repair the damage and salvage what could be salvaged.
Now it has grown into the DHTP which is a continuation of the JDTP but with all high resolution texture capable ports in mind.

The main goal of the DHTP is to provide the community with a space to easily contribute their own works, as well as offering a steady stream of feedback from both site visitors and administrators. It will also be a lot more tightly controlled than its predecessor, in regards to both copyrights and quality control.

## Participation

* If you create textures for this project please release them under a free to use and edit license (like the ones already in the pack). This will allow the community to help improve the textures in the future.

* If you are interested in participating, head over to the [Forum discussion](http://dengine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=875#topic) and post your textures for inclusion in the pack and discussion.

* Also you can report bugs and see the current WIP pack/improvements on [GitHub](https://github.com/KuriKai/DHTP/)

* For the textures to be in the pack there are a few important rules that I will outline here:
  1) Anything you submit MUST be entirely your own work or modifications of permission granted DHTP textures. You may not submit modifications of original id textures, as this constitutes copyright infringement.
  2) Only PNG images can be uploaded. This keeps the size down and the quality flawless.
